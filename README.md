## Hi there 👋


I'm Furkan Kasap, a computer engineer based in Turkey.

I'm currently learning and improving myself in AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I enjoy trying out new tools, building small prototypes, and exploring how modern ML systems work.

I'm pursuing my Master’s in Computer Engineering at Kocaeli University, where I focus on AI-related topics and practical machine learning applications.
